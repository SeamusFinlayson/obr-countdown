# Countdown

This Owlbear Rodeo extension adds a simple countdown timer to your room. 

Unlike other timer extensions, Countdown does not depend on the GM or creator being in the room to increment the time. Instead, it uses a start time saved to the room and your system time to determine the remaining timer time. The downside of this method is that it depends on your system clock being accurate.
